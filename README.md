SixSRCommand 0.1
----------------

PREFACE

There are three main parts to the radio system as a whole: the ruby/rails interface,
the icecast/ices radio server, and the interface between them.  As long as you have 
a mysql server installed somewhere, you should be able to run the interface.  Of
course, in order to run the radio broadcast part, you'll need the radio server.  But
that's only needed if you want to actually see the system in action :)

PREREQUISITES

* ruby and rails
* a mysql server
* radio server
* perl

INSTRUCTIONS

* download sixsrcommand-0.1.tar.bz2 from 6thstreetradio.org
* run 'tar xvfj sixsrcommand-0.1.tar.bz2' wherever you want to install it
* look at populate_test.sh, point it to your mysql server, and run it
* run the command 'scripts/server'. this will start the WEBRick webserver (so you
  don't have to worry about installing and configuring apache or anything).  This
  will open up on http://172.0.0.1:3000 by default
